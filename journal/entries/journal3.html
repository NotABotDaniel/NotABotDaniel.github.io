	<h1>My wordpress website</h1>
	<p>For this assignment, I had to make a website using wordpress.</p>
	<h3>My Website:</h3>
	<a href="http://deadpolarbrears.wordpress.com">Save the Dying Polar Bears</a>
	<h3>Reflection</h3>
	<p>
		Before making my website, I looked at 3 different websites in Arlington VA. The first of which was <a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Office-of-Sustainability-and-Environment/AIRE/Resources/Community-Energy-Plan">Arlington VA Community Energy Plan</a>. I saw that they presented lots of facts about what they planed to do. The second was <a href="https://shop.lung.org/ala_shop/shop/home">American Lung Association E-Store</a>. They sold merchandise to premote their company and spread awwarness. The third was <a href="https://earth.org/polar-bears-at-risk-of-starvation-as-arctic-ice-sheets-melt-scientists-warn/">Earth.org Polar Bears at Risk of Starvation as Arctic Ice Sheets Melt</a>. This site provided facts and iformation in an article format in order to spread awareness about dying Polar Bears. I took insperation from all 3 of these sites in order to compose my own.
