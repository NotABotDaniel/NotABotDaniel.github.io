	<p>For this assignment, I had to make a website using wordpress.</p>
	
	<h3>My Website:</h3>
	
	<a href="https://deadpolarbears.wordpress.com/about/">Save the Dying Polar Bears</a>
	
	<h3>Reflection</h3>
	
	<p>
		          Before making my website, I looked at 3 different websites in Arlington VA. The first of which was <a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Programs/Office-of-Sustainability-and-Environment/AIRE/Resources/Community-Energy-Plan">Arlington VA Community Energy Plan</a>. I saw that they presented lots of facts about what they planed to do. The second was <a href="https://shop.lung.org/ala_shop/shop/home">American Lung Association E-Store</a>. They sold merchandise to premote their company and spread awwarness. The third was <a href="https://earth.org/polar-bears-at-risk-of-starvation-as-arctic-ice-sheets-melt-scientists-warn/">Earth.org Polar Bears at Risk of Starvation as Arctic Ice Sheets Melt</a>. This site provided facts and information in an article format in order to spread awareness about dying Polar Bears. I took insperation from all 3 of these sites in order to compose my own.

		          While making my website, I encountereed many chalanges. First of all, my origional account was closed and I had to make a new one. After I did, formating the website went smothely for a while until I wanted to change the format of the bar at the top. I had to do many strange things with navigation in order to edit it. After that I published the page to see how it looked before I finished. Then, I found that navigation between pages became umbeleivibly difficult because it would seemingly randomly take you to the page view insted of the editing page. After a long time, I finaly got the hang of it and finnished the website.
