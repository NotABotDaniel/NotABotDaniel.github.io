# Taking Notes For Math class

Bellow are my notes for my math class. I was required to take these notes to showcase my website making abuilitys for my dual enrollment website development class.

# Simplifying radicals review

## Perfect Squares up to 10

You should hsve these memorized.

| Root | Square |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 9 |
| 4 | 16 |
| 5 | 25 |
| 6 | 36 |
| 7 | 49 |
| 8 | 64 |
| 9 | 81 |
| 10 | 100 |

## Simplifying Non-Perfect Square Roots

If not a perfect square, find the largest perfect square that the radicand is divisible by. Then break the radicand into those factors. finaly, take the roots of the perfect squares. Everything else should stay in the radical. Then numebrs outside get multiplied together.

### Example:

$\sqrt{12}$ seperates into $\sqrt{4}*\sqrt{3}$ which simplifyies to $2\sqrt{3}$

## Perfect Cubes up to 10

You shoudl know the first few of these. (like the first 5)

|Root|Cube|
|1|1|
|2|8|
|3|27|
|4|64|
|5|125|
|6|216|
|7|343|
|8|512|
|9|729|
|10|1000|

## Simplifying Cube Roots

Cube roots work the same way as square roots eccept you have to look for perfect cubes instead.

### Example:

$\cbrt{16}$ can seperate into $\cbrt{8}*\cbrt{2}$ which simplifyies into $2\cbrt{2}$
