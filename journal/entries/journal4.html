    <p>My group set up this website: <a href="http://notabotdaniel.github.io/OffThePike">Off The Pike</a></p>
    <p>
        For the project, I made the form for updating your reservations 
        (linked at the bottom of the reservations page) and I made the entire menu. 
        The menu has its own navigation bar to switch bettween the 4 pages within it (entres, sides, drinks, &amp; deserts).
    </p>

    <img class="midimg" src="../../image/menu2.png" alt="menu screenshot">
    <p>
        These screenshots show the menu I designed. 
        The entres page contains images from the real menu but the other pages have temporary 
        AI images to give the cullinary staff a good idea of what the website will look like.

        This screenshot shows the update reservation page I designed. 
        I copied some of the ideas from the reservation page owen had but I also added some styles to both, 
        such as patterns for the phone numbers and placeholders for the text questions.
    </p>

        Looking back on this project, I see that we could have tried to plan out the style for the site before we started making it. 
        Other than that, I am fairly proud of the work we did. We managed to work concurenty in github and get the project done in time.
