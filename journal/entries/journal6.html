        For my final project, I took on an ambitious goal. 
        I decided to create a 3D simulation complete with spheres and shaddows.
        This turned out to be even more difficult than I anticipated, 
        Not because of the complexity of the program (even though it was exremely complicated), 
        but because of the various technical issues I experienced. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My first attempt at the project didn't go so well. 
        I tried to use ray tracing like in my maze game project 
        (<a href="../../projects/mazeGame.html">mazeGame.html</a>) but 3D. 
        This required way too much computing power with the simple mechanics that I created, 
        and the html pages wouldnt even open. 
        Eventualy, I decided to scrap that method and try something else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did some research on other way to render 3D objects 
        and found this triangle baised projection mothod.
        For this, I needed to design a way to store the coordinates of all the points in a 
        sphere, and then generate all the triangles between the right points.
        Then I would need to exclude triangles facing away from the camera,
        and finaly I woudld need to do a ton of math in order to see whether 
        a face would reflect any light.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first I decided to store the coordinates of the point in a list in groups of 3. 
        (I later changed this to a list that held objects with x,y,z coords)
        I created a function that calculated the coordinates using a 3D distance formula 
        I found online. Throughout the project I made all constants changable at the top of the code.
        This included the radius and rezolution of the sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        To generate the triangles, I wrote out the sequence of indexes of the points in 
        the coords list that represented the triangles. First, it would connect the bottom 
        point to all the others around it (0,1,2;0,2,3;0,3,4). Then, It would connect the points in quads.
        For each horisontal segment, it would cycle through all of the verticle slices. For each of those,
        it connected the base point to the one on the row above and the next one on that row. 
        Then it would connect that one to the next one on the row above and then the next one on the same row.
        This was repeated for the whole sphere and then the cap was repeated for the top.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, I had an image of a bouncing wireframe ball. I could have stopped here, 
        but I was ditermened to create shaddows like I had set out to do.
        Note that throughtout this portion of the project, I was not able to use the inspect tool.
        I later restarted multiple times until it worked again.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        I then needed a way to exlude the faces in the other direction. 
        I realizede that I could just make the closer triangles drawn first, 
        so the triangles on the other side would be hidden behind them.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        Finaly came the most difficult portion of the project, 
        I needed to color the faces based on how they reflected the light.
        To do this, I reasoned that the closer the angle of the face was to the 
        average of the angles twoard the camera and the light, the lighter colored it should be.
        This required an immense amount of math that I do not wish to go into, but baisically, 
        I callculated all of the angles neccesary for input and found how close they were 
        (using formulas from online).
    
    </p>
    <p>
        The final product includes one ball bouncing around the screen with shaddows. 
        I attemped at moving the camera around but it didn't work well. 
        I also tried to make the bounds visible but failed.
        Despite this, it looks amazing and I am proud of my work.
