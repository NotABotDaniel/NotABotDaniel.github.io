	<h3>What is a fire banana?</h3>

	<p>
Despite its fiery name, this banana won’t actually catch fire. However, if you were to consume it after the experiment, you might experience an intense sensation that feels like your mouth is on fire! This unique banana is designed to be highly reactive when combined with water, creating an exciting and dramatic reaction. While the Fire Banana is a fun and educational experiment, it’s important to note that the sodium acetate and the reaction it produces can be hazardous if ingested in large quantities. Consuming this banana after the experiment is not recommended, as it could lead to serious health risks. Always prioritize safety and conduct this experiment in a controlled environment. Have fun exploring the science behind the Fire Banana, but remember that it will kill you. Enjoy your day!</p>

	<br>

	<h3>WARNING</H3>
	<P>If you dare to consume the Fire Banana after it has been treated with sodium acetate and water, prepare for a shocking experience. As the sodium acetate reacts with the moisture in your mouth, it can create an intense burning sensation that feels like a wildfire spreading across your tongue and throat.
</p><p>
The moment you take a bite, the chemical reaction begins, releasing heat and causing a tingling, almost searing pain that radiates through your mouth. Your taste buds may scream in protest as the sharp, acrid flavor overwhelms your senses, leaving you gasping for relief.
</p><p>
As the reaction intensifies, you might feel a wave of nausea wash over you, your stomach churning as it struggles to process the foreign substance. The burning sensation could escalate, making it feel as though your throat is lined with fire, leading to difficulty swallowing and an urgent need for water.
</p><p>
In severe cases, consuming the Fire Banana could lead to chemical burns in your mouth and throat, resulting in swelling, blistering, and excruciating pain. The aftermath could leave you in distress, requiring medical attention to alleviate the damage caused by this reckless experiment.</p>

	<h3>Recipie/Prosedure</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Prepare Banana
			<ul>
				<li>Use a knife to cut a small opening in the side of your banana.</li>
				<li>Insert the syringe into the opening and pull the plunger.</li>
				<li>There should now be room in you banana for the chemicals.</li>
				<li>Wash syringe thouroughly, you will use it again later.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Insert Sosium Acetate
			<ul>
				<li>Fill the syringe with sodium acetate.</li>
				<li>Ensure you have an apropriate amount to fill the space you emptied in the banana.</li> 
				<li>You can compare it to the amount of banana removed using the syringe earlier.</li>
				<li>Insert syringe into opening and push plunger.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Seal Opening
			<ul>
				<li>Wrap tape or wrap around the banana</li>
				<li>Make sure that it is covering the hole.</li>
				<li>Wrap tightly around several times.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>How to start the reaction</h3>

	<p>Inject the water using the nedle and observe the reaction. The banana may burst from the pressure inside and release a bubbly yellow substance everywhere.</p>
