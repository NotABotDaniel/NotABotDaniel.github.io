	<h1>html lesson: the File Tree</h1>
	<p>There are many files on your computer. They are organdised in different folders/directories at different levels. This gets very complex and confusing quickly so we like to visualize it using a diagram called a tree.</p>

	<p>The idea is that when in any folder in the terminal, you know your location and the path you took to get there.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Example:
	<ol type="1">
		<li><code>/</code></li>
		<li><code>User</code></li>
		<li><code>Desktop</code></li>
		<li><code>Website</code></li>
		<li><code>Index.html</code></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<p>"<code> / </code>" is at the top. Under it, everything on your computer is stored. In "<code> user </code>" there are several folders for stuff stored on your computer.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>This includes:
	<ul>
		<li><code>Desktop</code></li>
		<li><code>Documents</code></li>
		<li><code>Downloads</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
